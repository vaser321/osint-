Starting from Espionage and ending at OSINT, our data
gathering techniques has been developed magnificently.
In 90's, the security posture of national security, law enforcement agencies,
Cyber Security agencies was totally different. At that time, gathering
data about someone was very difficult due to fewer Internet resources.
But, this digital era has overcome the techniques used for information
gathering in 90's by Intelligence Gathering. It includes gathering data
from various public sources and their API. Intelligence Gathering
includes human, geo-location, open-source, signals, digital and
financial intelligence.

OSINT-SPY can find information about a person, email, an organization,
person's geolocation, domain names, publically available devices on the
internet and so on. It can be used by Data Miners, Infosec Researchers,
Penetration Testers and Cyber Crime Investigators in order to find
deep information about their target.
